# Create-ink!-dapp

## Overview

Create-ink!-dapp is a development tool for creating ink! smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Polkadot network. It provides a streamlined workflow for developing, testing, and deploying ink! projects.

## Features

- **VSCode Workspace Integration**: It's recommended to develop in VSCode by opening the workspace file `inkathon.code-workspace` for a more predictable monorepo configuration.
- **Recommended Plugins**: The boilerplate recommends several VSCode plugins for enhanced development experience.
- **Live Demo Deployment**: Provides a live demo deployment of the boilerplate at [inkathon.xyz](https://inkathon.xyz).
- **Deployment via Vercel**: Spinning up a deployment via Vercel is straightforward as the necessary settings are already configured in `vercel.json`.
- **Customization**: Provides customization options for project name, custom contracts, and custom scripts.
